- Time zone and cultural calendar integration

### **PHASE 3: Marketplace & Ecosystem (6-12 months)**

#### 3.1 Agent Marketplace Revolution
```typescript
interface AgentMarketplaceItem {
  id: string;
  creatorId: string;
  agentTemplate: AgentTemplate;
  specialization: IndustrySpecialization;
  performance_metrics: {
    successRate: number;
    avgExecutionTime: number;
    userSatisfactionScore: number;
    totalInstallations: number;
  };
  pricing: {
    model: 'free' | 'one-time' | 'subscription' | 'usage-based';
    basePrice: number;
    revenueShare: number;
  };
  certification: {
    verified: boolean;
    industryCompliance: string[];
    securityRating: SecurityRating;
  };
}
```

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### **1. Backend Architecture Enhancement**

#### Current State Assessment:
```
✅ FastAPI Agent Service (Python) - Solid foundation
✅ Express Orchestrator (Node.js) - Good coordination layer  
✅ Microservice Manager - Proper service communication
⚠️ Missing: Virtual environment management
⚠️ Missing: Multi-agent coordination
❌ Missing: Real-time task execution engine
```

#### Required Additions:
1. **Container Orchestration Layer** (Docker + K8s for production)
2. **Agent Execution Environment** (Sandboxed environments per agent)
3. **Real-time Communication Hub** (WebSocket + message queues)
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination Service** (Task distribution + conflict resolution)

### **2. Frontend Revolution Requirements**

#### Canvas Transformation:
- Replace static React Flow with dynamic execution visualization
- Real-time agent state monitoring
- Live data flow visualization
- Interactive debugging interface
- Collaborative editing with conflict resolution

#### New Components Needed:
```typescript
// Real-time Agent Monitor
interface AgentMonitorComponent {
  agentId: string;
  realTimeState: AgentExecutionState;
  performanceMetrics: RealtimeMetrics;
  interventionControls: InterventionControls;
}

// Multi-Agent Coordination View
interface MeshOrchestrationView {
  meshId: string;
  agents: AgentVisualNode[];
  taskFlow: TaskFlowVisualization;
  collaborationPatterns: CollaborationPattern[];
}
```

### **3. Security & Compliance Framework**

#### Enhanced Security Model:
```typescript
interface GenesisSecurityModel {
  agentSandboxing: {
    containerIsolation: boolean;
